# Mario 64 Super-Star Battle todo list

## Specific

+ Add feature to a PDF with final results (could support other formats,
  too, like Markdown, plain text, JSON)

## Less Specific

+ Add high-coverage tests for Travis CI
+ Handle ties better

## Much less specific

+ Have results persist between different Mario battles (could host info
  on a webserver, or in a file, or ...?)
